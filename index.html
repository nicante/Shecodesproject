        <span class="chile">Chile</span>, a country located in the most southern
        part of South America, a place where the summer is wintertime which is
        the opposite of how it is in the United States, I've come to find that
        it is not something that people understand when you tell them this, for
        a lot of people it doesn't make sense when something is different from
        what they've always known. That is why it is so important to travel and
        get to experience other cultures and ways of living- even climates!
        <br />
        <br />
        This past summer I visited Chile, coming from the US seemed so far away
        and the trip felt incredibly long and tiring. I was happy to leave the
        sunshine of summer to go to the winter, don't get me wrong. Never
        thought after living in the US that I would experience a cold summer. It
        was truly amazing, getting to know a new city and new people. I was
        amazed to see how beautiful the Cordillera of the Andes was hugging the
        whole city of Santiago, I would recommend everyone to go to Chile just
        to see this, it is something almost unreal and overwhelming, as though
        it wasn't really there and you are just imagining things, although I
        could have never come up with something that beautiful in my mind.
